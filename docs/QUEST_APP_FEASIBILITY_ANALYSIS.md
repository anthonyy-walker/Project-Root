### Revenue Calculations

#### Scenario 1: Conservative Start (100 Active Users)
```
Daily Activity:
├── 100 active users
├── 2 plays per day average
├── 20 minutes per session
└── = 66.7 hours/day

Weekly Metrics:
├── 467 hours total playtime
├── Revenue: $23-33/week ($93-132/month)
└── Prize budget needed: $30-50/week

Result: ❌ NOT break-even (need subsidization)
```

#### Scenario 2: Moderate Scale (300 Active Users)
```
Daily Activity:
├── 300 active users
├── 2.5 plays per day average
├── 20 minutes per session
└── = 250 hours/day

Weekly Metrics:
├── 1,750 hours total playtime
├── Revenue: $88-123/week ($350-490/month)
└── Prize budget: $90-120/week

Result: ✅ BREAK-EVEN ACHIEVED
Peak CCU: ~45 players (enough for discovery!)
```

#### Scenario 3: Optimal Scale (500 Active Users)
```
Daily Activity:
├── 500 active users
├── 3 plays per day average
├── 22 minutes per session
└── = 550 hours/day

Weekly Metrics:
├── 3,850 hours total playtime
├── Revenue: $193-270/week ($770-1,080/month)
└── Prize budget: $120-180/week

Result: ✅ PROFITABLE + sustains growth
Peak CCU: ~75 players (strong discovery placement!)
Net profit: $70-150/week for operations & growth
```

#### Scenario 4: Success Case (1,000 Active Users)
```
Daily Activity:
├── 1,000 active users
├── 3 plays per day average
├── 25 minutes per session
└── = 1,250 hours/day

Weekly Metrics:
├── 8,750 hours total playtime
├── Revenue: $438-613/week ($1,750-2,450/month)
└── Prize budget: $200-300/week

## 📈 Discovery Impact Multiplier

**Key Insight:** Once you hit discovery, organic growth accelerates dramatically.

### Without Discovery (Organic Only)
- User acquisition cost: $2-5 per user
- Growth rate: 10-20% monthly
- Retention: 30-40%

### With Discovery Placement
- Organic installs: 50-200/day from discovery traffic
- Growth rate: 40-80% monthly  
- Retention: 45-60% (higher quality users)
- **Free marketing worth $500-2,000/month**

**Example:** Map with 50 CCU in discovery can get 1,000-5,000 new players/week organically.

## ⚠️ Risks & Considerations

### Legal/Compliance Risks
1. **Age restrictions:** COPPA compliance for under-13 users
   - Need parental consent systems
   - No direct communication with minors
   - Strict data privacy controls

2. **Gambling concerns:** Prize-based competitions might be regulated
   - Skill-based vs. chance-based (your model is skill = OK)
   - May need legal review per jurisdiction
   - Terms of service must be airtight

3. **Epic Games ToS:** Ensure your app doesn't violate Epic policies
   - Can't promise V-Bucks you don't control
   - Must clearly state "not affiliated with Epic"
   - Risk of ban if Epic sees it as exploitative

### Operational Risks
1. **Cheating/Exploitation:** Players using hacks, bots, alt accounts
   - Need robust anti-cheat detection
   - Manual review for top winners
   - Ban systems

2. **Payment fraud:** Stolen credit cards, charge-backs
   - Use reputable payment processors
   - Fraud detection systems

3. **Customer support:** Handling disputes, prizes, tech issues
   - Need support team/system at scale

### Financial Risks
1. **Negative margins early:** Will lose money months 1-4
   - Need $2,000-5,000 runway capital
   
2. **Scaling costs:** Server, payment processing, support
   - AWS/cloud: $50-200/month at scale
   - Payment fees: 3-5% of prize pool
   - Support: $500-2,000/month if outsourced

3. **Epic payout delays:** Revenue paid 60-90 days after earning
   - Need cash flow management
   - Can't rely on immediate revenue

## 🎲 Comparison to FCHQ Model

### FCHQ's Approach (Proven Success)
- **Scale:** 10,000+ active users
- **Prize pools:** $1,000-10,000/quest (sponsored)
- **Revenue model:** Sponsorships + Epic engagement payouts
- **Platform:** PC app (Overwolf-style overlay)
- **Target:** Ages 13+ (hardcore gamers)

### Your Model Differences
- **Scale:** 500-1,000 users (achievable)
- **Prize pools:** $30-200/quest (self-funded initially)
- **Revenue model:** Pure Epic payouts initially
- **Platform:** Mobile app (accessibility)
- **Target:** Ages 5-15 (casual, younger audience)

### Advantages Over FCHQ
1. **Younger demographic:** Less competition, high engagement
2. **Mobile-first:** More accessible (kids use phones/tablets)
3. **Lower entry barrier:** Smaller prizes = more winners
4. **Simplicity:** Focused on fun, not hardcore competition

### Disadvantages vs. FCHQ
1. **No sponsors initially:** Must self-fund prizes
2. **Compliance complexity:** COPPA, age restrictions
3. **Smaller revenue per user:** Kids play less/shorter sessions
4. **Parental gatekeeping:** Need parent buy-in

## ✅ Final Recommendation

### YES, This is Viable - But Start Small

**Minimum Viable Product:**
- **Required capital:** $3,000-5,000 (6 months runway)
- **Time to break-even:** 4-6 months
- **Time to profitability:** 6-9 months

**Success Factors:**
1. Start with 1-2 high-quality maps (fun, replayable)
2. Simple quests (eliminations, survival time, collectibles)
3. Weekly prize pools: $30-50 (10-15 winners)
4. Target 100-150 users in month 1
5. Focus on retention over acquisition early
6. Build community (Discord, social features)

**When to Scale:**
- Hit 200+ active users with 30%+ weekly retention
- Achieve 30-50 peak CCU consistently
- Positive unit economics (revenue > prize costs)
- Strong community engagement (Discord activity, referrals)

**Expected Timeline:**
```
Month 1-2:  MVP + 100 users + validation
Month 3-4:  200 users + discovery visibility
Month 5-6:  300 users + break-even
Month 7-9:  500 users + profitability
Month 10-12: 1,000 users + seek Series A / sponsorships
```
